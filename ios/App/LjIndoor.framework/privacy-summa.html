<h1>LJ PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY </h1>
<p>Summa Health Systems have contracted with LogicJunction Inc.(<strong>"LJ" </strong> or <strong>"we"</strong>)to develop a mobile application (<strong>"App"</strong>) as a service to visitors and patients at Summa Health System (<strong>Hospital"</strong>)  and other users (<strong>"User"</strong> or <strong>"you"</strong>) at Summa Health System (the <strong>Hospital</strong>). The Hospital licenses the App and owns the data thereon.  
<p>LJ may also provide wayfinding services at Hospital-based kiosks or through a wayfinding website. Please refer to any privacy policies posted by LJ on those platforms for additional information.</p>

<p>Users need not register for the App and activity data is anonymous unless the User opts to share personal information, which may include a name, email address, postal address or other information that can be used to personally identify a User as defined under various laws ("PI").   By using the App, you are consenting to these terms and the use and processing of your PI, if you have chosen to share such, within the United States. Certain non-identifiable data may be stored on servers outside of the United States.  Where required by law, we will obtain your explicit consent to the collection or processing PI. </p>

<h3>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY TERMS, DO NOT USE THE APP.</h3>
<h4>What Kind of Information LJ Collects:  </h4>
<p>LJ will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you use the App, unless you choose to provide such information to us.  You may have the option, where applicable, to submit information to the App by sending an email or submitting information through certain forms available on App. You need not provide any PI to access the App, however, in order for Hospital to communicate with you, PI such as your contact information might need to be submitted.</p>
<p>The following table describes how LJ (along with third-party subcontractors with their own secure privacy practices) use certain User information in order to perform services:</p>

<h4>Sharing User Information</h4>
<p>Except as described below, <strong>only anonymized or aggregate data is shared</strong> with external services to enable the performance of the App, however LJ reserves the right share any and all information, including PI, with the Hospital.</p>
<h5>We only share your PI with outside parties when:</h5>
<ul>
<li>You have provided your explicit consent to share the information. </li>
<li>We use a third party in order to perform the service you requested. </li>
<li>We use a third party subcontractor with its own secure privacy practices, for LJ business functions relating to the App.</li>
<li>We are required by law to provide your information or we find that your actions on the App violate LJ terms of use to the extent that an outside investigation is warranted.</li>
<li>We reasonably believe that doing so is necessary to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LJ, the Hospital or others..</li>
<li>We sell or otherwise transfer such information to a successor or subsidiary of LJ, which shall be done under the same provisions as set out above.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will provide you with notice if we believe we are compelled to comply with an authorized third party's request for information.</p>
<p>In all the above cases, only the minimal amount of PI, as is necessary to complete the specific action, shall be shared with the outside party.</p>
<h4>Opting-Out, Accessing and Deleting your PI</h4>
