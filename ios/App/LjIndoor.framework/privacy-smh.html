<h1>LJ APP PRIVACY AND SECURITY</h1>
<h3 class="last-updated">Last Updated on October 30, 2018 </h3>
<p>We have contracted with LogicJunction Inc.(<strong>"LJ"</strong> or <strong>"we"</strong>)to develop a mobile application (<strong>"App"</strong>)  as a service to visitors and patients at Sarasota Memorial Health Care System (<strong>"Hospital"</strong>) and other users (<strong>"User"</strong> or <strong>"you"</strong>) at Sarasota Memorial Health Care System (the <strong>"Hospital"</strong>). The Hospital licenses the App and owns the data thereon.</p>
<p>LJ may also provide wayfinding services at Hospital-based kiosks or through a wayfinding website. Please refer to any privacy policies posted by LJ on those platforms for additional information.</p>
<p>Users need not register for the App and activity data is anonymous unless the User opts to share personal information, which may include a name, email address, postal address or other information that can be used to personally identify a User as defined under various laws (<strong>"PI"</strong>). By using the App, you are consenting to these terms and the use and processing of your PI, if you have chosen to share such, within the United States. Certain non-identifiable data may be stored on servers outside of the United States.  Where required by law, we will obtain your explicit consent to the collection or processing PI. </p>
<h3>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY TERMS, DO NOT USE THE APP.</h3>
<h3 class="last-updated">What Kind of Information LJ Collects: </h3>

        <h2>UNDERSTANDING YOUR MEDICAL INFORMATION</h2>
        Medical information is information about your past, present or future healthcare that may identify you (such as your name, address,  social  security  number),  as  well  as  your  symptoms,  examinations,  test  results,  diagnoses,  treatment,  and  plans for future care.  This medical and billing information is protected by law and is frequently referred to as "Protected Health Information," or PHI.</br></br>
        <h2>OUR PLEDGE REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION</h2>
            We understand that your medical information is personal.  We are required by law to:</br></br>
        <ul><li>Make sure your medical information is private;</li>
            <li>Give you this Notice of our legal duties;</li>
            <li>Follow the terms of this Notice;</li>
            <li>Provide you with notice if the privacy or security of your PHI is breached.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Notice of Privacy Practices will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose your medical information.  It  also  describes  your  rights,  as  well  as  certain  responsibilities  that  we  have,  regarding  your  medical  information.    We understand  that  information  about  you  and  your  health  is  very  personal.  Therefore,  we  strive  to  protect  your  privacy  as required by law. We will only use and disclose your PHI as allowed by law.</p>
        <p>We  are  committed  to  excellence  in  the  provision  of  state-&shy;of-&shy;the-&shy;art  health  care  services  through  the  practice  of  patient care,  education,  and  research.  Therefore,  as  described  below,  your  health  information  will  be  used  to  provide  you  care and may be used to educate health care professionals and for research purposes. We train our staff and workforce to be sensitive about privacy and to respect the confidentiality of your PHI.</p>
        <h2>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h2>
            The  following  categories  describe  different  ways  that  we  may  use  and   disclose  your  medical  information  without  your written  authorization.    All  of  the  ways  we  are  permitted  to  use  and  disclose  information  will  fall  within  one  of  these categories:</br></br>
        <ul>
            <li><em>For Treatment:</em> We may use or disclose your medical information to provide, coordinate or manage your healthcare treatment  and  related  services.   This  information  may  be  shared  with  doctors,  nurses,  advanced  practice  providers, technicians,  health  care  students,  or  others  who  are  involved  in  your  care.   For  example,  a  doctor  treating  you  for  a broken  leg  may  need  to  know  if  you  have  diabetes  because  diabetes  may  slow  the  healing  process.   In  addition  we may   share   medical   information   about   you   in   order   to   coordinate   the   different   things   you   may  need,  such   as prescriptions,  lab work,  and  x-&shy;rays.   It  may  also  be  necessary  to  disclose  medical  information  about  you  to  people outside Sarasota Memorial Health Care System who are involved in your medical care after you leave our care.  For example,  we  may  disclose  your  medical  information  to  a  home  health  agency  or  to  a  physician  to  whom  you  have been referred.  This is to ensure that the agency or physician has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you.</li>
            <li><em>For Payment:</em> We  may  use  and  disclose  medical  information  about  you  so  that  the  treatment  services  you  receive may be billed to, and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company, or a third party.  Before you receive scheduled  services,  we  may  share  information  about  these  services  with  your  health  plan(s)  to  obtain  prior  approval or  to  determine  whether  your  insurance  will  cover  the  treatment.   For  example,  we  may  need  to  give  your  insurance company information about your surgery so they will pay us or reimburse you for the surgery.  Also, we may tell your insurance company about a treatment or service you are going to receive in order to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment or service.</li>
            <li><em>For  Healthcare  Operations:</em> We  may  use  or  disclose  medical  information  about  you  as  needed  for  our  business activities  and  health  care  operations.  These  uses  and  disclosures  allow  us  to  improve  the  quality  of  care  we  provide and reduce healthcare costs.  Examples of these activities include, but are not limited to:</li>
                <ul><li>Reviewing and improving the quality, efficiency and cost of care that we provide to you and other patients.</li>
                    <li>Evaluating the skills, qualifications, and performance of healthcare providers taking care of you.</li>
                    <li>Providing  training  programs  for  students,  trainees,  healthcare  providers  or  non-&shy;healthcare  professionals  (for example, billing clerks) to help them practice or improve their skills.</li>
                    <li>Cooperating with outside organizations that assess the quality of care we provide. These organizations might include government agencies or accrediting bodies like the Joint Commission and the DNV GL Healthcare.</li>
                    <li>Cooperating with outside organizations that evaluate, certify or license healthcare providers, staff or facilities in  a  particular  field  or  specialty.  For  example,  we  may  use  or  disclose  health  information  so  that  one  of  our nurses may become certified in a specific field of nursing.</li>
                    <li>Sharing information with Sarasota Memorial Public Safety to maintain safety at our facilities.</li>
                    <li>Assisting  various  people  who  review  our  activities.  Health  information  may  be  seen  by  doctors  reviewing services provided to you, and by accountants, lawyers and others who assist us in complying with applicable laws.</li>
                    <li>Conducting  business  management  and  general  administrative  activities  related  to  our  organizations  and services we provide.</li>
                    <li>Resolving grievances within our organizations.</li>
                    <li>Complying with this Notice and with applicable laws.</li>
                    <li>Review the quality of our treatment and services, or to send you a patient satisfaction survey</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>The  sharing  of  your  PHI  for  treatment,  payment,  and  health  care  operations  may  happen  electronically.  Electronic communications enable fast, secure access to your information for those participating in and coordinating your care to improve the overall quality of your health and prevent delays in treatment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Health  Information  Exchanges</em>: We  participate  in  initiatives  to  facilitate  this  electronic  sharing,  including,  but  not limited  to,  Health  Information  Exchanges  (HIEs)  which  involve  coordinated  information  sharing  among  HIE  members for  purposes  of  treatment,  payment,  and  health  care  operations.  Patients  may  opt-&shy;out  of  some  of  these  electronic sharing  initiatives,  such  as  HIEs.  Sarasota  Memorial  Health  Care  System  will  use  reasonable  efforts  to  limit  the sharing  of  PHI  in  such  electronic  sharing  initiatives  for  patients  who  have  opted-&shy;out.  If  you  wish  to  opt-&shy;out,  please contact us by following the instructions on our website or by calling (941) 917-&shy;6622.</li>
            <li><em>Business  Associates:</em> We  may  share  your  medical  information  with  third  party  "business  associates"  who  perform various services for our health care system.  For example, we may send your medical information to a company that assists us in billing, to a transcription service that assists us in maintaining your medical record, or to a copy service that assists us in copying your medical record.  The law requires our business associates to appropriately safeguard your medical information.</li>
            <li><em>Appointment  Reminders:</em> We  may  contact  you  by  phone  or  leave  a  message  to  remind  you  of  an  appointment,  or request you call the office or hospital.</li>
            <li><em>Treatment  Alternatives:</em> We  may  use  and  disclose  your  medical  information  to  tell  you  about  or  recommend treatment  options  or  alternatives,  as  long  as  we  are  not  using  your  information  for  marketing  purposes,  as  defined under the law.</li>
            <li><em>Health-&shy;Related Benefits and Services:</em> We may use your medical information to contact you and offer other health-&shy; related  services  or  medical  education  that  may  be  of  interest  to  you,  as  long  as  we  are  not  marketing  to  you.   For example, we may send you a newsletter by using your name and U.S. mail address.</li>
            <li><em>Personal Health Records System (PHR):</em> We may use your medical information and health history provided by you for purposes of providing this service to you, as well as communicating with you through the use of a PHR.</li>
            <li><em>Individuals  Involved  in  Your  Care:</em>  We  may  disclose  your  medical  information  to  a  family  member  or  other  person you allow to be present and involved in your care, such as a friend, relative or spouse.  We will only disclose medical information relevant to that person's involvement in your care or payment for your care.  In an emergency situation we may  use  and  disclose  your  medical  information  to  locate  and  notify  a  family  member,  a  personal  representative,  or another  person  responsible  for  your  location  and  general  condition.   We  may  also  disclose  limited  PHI  to  a  public  or private entity that is authorized to assist in disaster relief efforts to locate a family member or other persons who may be involved  in some aspect of caring for you.   If you are unable to agree or object to this disclosure, we may disclose such information as we deem is in your best interest based on our professional judgment.</li>
            <li><em>Facility Directory:</em>  If applicable, we may include limited information about you in the facility directory while you are a patient  at  the  hospital  or  one  of  our  related  health  care  companies.   For  example,  this  information  may  include  your name,  location  in  the  hospital,  your  general  condition  (e.g.,  fair,  stable,  etc.),  and  your  religious  affiliation.    The directory  information,  except  for  your  religious  affiliation,  may  be  released  to  people  who  ask  for  you  by  name.  However, directory information, including your religious affiliation, may be released to a member of the clergy even if they don't ask for you by name.</li><br>
            You have the right to object to being listed in the directory.  If you are unable to agree or object, we may include the information  we  deem  is  in  your  best  interest  based  on  our  professional  judgment.   In  addition,  we  may  also  disclose information  about  you  during  a  disaster  relief  effort  so  that  your  family  can  be  notified.    If  you  do  not  want  your information  listed  in  the  hospital  directory,  please  notify  Registration  when  you  arrive  or  call  the  facility's  Patient Registration Office.
            <li><em>Research:</em>  We may use and disclose your PHI, including PHI generated for use in a research study, as permitted by law for research, subject to your explicit authorization and/or oversight by the Sarasota Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB), committees charged with protecting the privacy rights, and safety of human subject research, or a  similar  committee.   For  example,  a  research  project  may  involve  comparing  the  health  and  recovery  of  all  patients with the same condition who received one medication to those who received another. Also, clinicians may request our clinical  research  staff  to  review  your  medical  information  to  see  if  you  would  be  eligible  for  a  study.    All  research projects,  however,  are  subject  to  a  special  approval  process.  In  all  cases  where  your  specific  authorization  has  not been  obtained,  your  privacy  will  be  protected  by  confidentiality  requirements  evaluated  by  such  a  committee.  For example,  the  IRB  may  approve  the  use  of  your  health  information  with  only  limited  identifying  information  to  conduct outcomes research to see if a particular procedure is effective.</li>
            <li><em>Fundraising Activities</em>:  We may use your health information to contact you or your legal representative in an effort to   raise   money   for   Sarasota   Memorial   Health   Care   System   and   its   operations.     We  would  only   use  contact information,  such  as  your  name,  address  and  phone  number,  department  of  service,  treating  physician,  outcome information,  health  insurance  status  and  dates  you  received  treatment  or  services.    We  may  send  you  information about   the  Sarasota   Memorial   Healthcare   Foundation,   an  organization  that   raises   funds   in  support   of   Sarasota Memorial Health Care System.  Sarasota Memorial Healthcare Foundation may solicit fundraising donations from you;อพ however, should you decide to opt out of receiving future information you will be given the opportunity to do so.  If you would  like  to  opt  out  at  the  time  of  your  visit  or  if  you  have  previously  signed  a  consent  authorizing  the  provision  of information  to  the  Sarasota  Memorial  Healthcare  Foundation  for  fundraising  purposes,  please  let  the  registrar  know that you would like to opt out now from any future provision of information.  You may also call the Foundation at 941-917-&shy;1286, email them through the Contact Us screen at <a href="http://www.smhf.org/">www.smhf.org</a>, or write to them at SMHF, 1515 South Osprey Avenue, Suite B-&shy;4, Sarasota, Florida, 34239 and ask them to remove you from their mailing list.</li>
            <li><em>As  Required  By  Law:</em>   We  will  disclose  your  medical  information  under  special  situations  as  required  by  federal, state, or local law or other judicial or administrative proceedings.</li>

        <h2>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</h2>
            You have the following rights regarding medical information we maintain about you:
        <ul>
            <li><em>The  Right  to  Access  and  Copy:</em> You  have  the  right  to  access  and  obtain  a  copy  of  your  medical  information  that may  be  used  to  make  decisions  about  your  care.   This  includes  medical  and  billing  records,  health  plan  enrollment, payments, adjudicated claims, and case or medical management record systems, but may not include psychotherapy notes or other information that is subject to laws that prohibit access.<br>
                If  we  maintain  your  records  electronically,  and  you  request  to  access  your  information  electronically,  we  will  provide you with access to your information in the form and format you request, if possible.  If it is not possible, we will provide you with the information in a readable electronic form and format to which you agree.<br>
                    We  may  deny  your  request  to  access  and  copy  in  certain  limited  circumstances.  Written  notice  of  denial  will  be provided;อพ   this   may   include  electronic   communication  if   appropriate.   If   you  are  denied   access   to  your   medical information you may request that the denial be reviewed, subject to the laws regarding whether a denial is reviewable. Another  licensed  health  care  professional  chosen  by  the  hospital  or  one  of  our  related  health  care  companies  will review  your  request  and  the  denial.    This  health  care  professional  will  not  be  the  person  who  denied  your  initial request, and we will comply with the outcome of that review.<br>
                        To  access  and  request  a  copy  of  your  medical  information,  please  contact  the  appropriate  Privacy  Officer  or  the hospital's Health Information Management Department by calling the telephone number listed on the last page of this Notice. A fee may be charged for making copies. We will respond to your request within 30 days, or will let you know within 30 days that we need additional time to respond to the request (if the information you request is not maintained or accessible on-&shy;site.)
                </li></ul>
        <p><em>Note:  The  right  to  access  belongs  primarily  to  the  individual  who  is  the  subject  of  the  PHI,  but  a  person  who  is legally  authorized  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  individual  regarding  health  care  matters  is  granted  the  same  right  of access.  An  individual's  legal  authority  to  act  on  behalf  of  an  individual  with  regard  to  health  care  matters  is determined  by  state  law.  Any  person,  who  requests  PHI,  as  well  as  the  person's  authority  to  have  access  to  the information, will be verified in accordance with SMHCS policies and procedures.</em></p>
        <p>You  may  also  ask  us,  in  a  written  request  signed  by  you,  to  send  a  copy  of  your  PHI  to  another  person  who  you designate.</p>
        <ul><li><em>The Right to Amend:</em>If you think that the medical information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask  us  to  amend,  or  correct  the  information.    You  have  the  right  to  request  an  amendment  for  as  long  as  the information  is  kept  by,  or  for,  our  hospital  or  one  of  our  related  health  care  companies.   To  request  an  amendment, please contact the appropriate Privacy Officer or the hospital's Health Information Management Department by calling the  telephone  number  listed  on  the  last  page  of  this  Notice.  Reasonable  efforts  will  be  taken  to  communicate  the amendment to others in the network within a reasonable time frame.<br>
            You will be required to provide a reason that supports your request.  Please note that we may deny your request if you ask us to amend information that:
            <ul><li>Was not created by us, unless the author or entity that created the information is no longer available to make the amendment;</li>
                <li>Is not part of the medical information kept by or for our hospital or our related health care companies;</li>
                <li>Is not part of the information which you would be permitted to review and copy;</li>
                <li>We believe the information is accurate and complete.</li>
            </ul><br>
            If  your  request  is  denied,  but  you  continue  to  dispute  the  accuracy  of  the  information,  you  will  be  provided  an opportunity to file a statement of disagreement. This statement of disagreement will be provided with any subsequent disclosure  of   disputed  PHI.   Please  contact   the  appropriate  Privacy   Officer   or   the  hospital's   Health   Information Management Department by calling the telephone number listed on the last page of this Notice.<br>
               Note:  Changes  to  non-&shy;clinical  information  such  as  changes  of  address,  insurance  information,  date  of  birth,  etc.  are not amendments and may be routinely processed.<br>

                    We are required to agree to your request to restrict disclosure of your PHI to a health plan or other third party payor if the  disclosure  is  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  payment  or  health  care  operations  and  is  not  otherwise  required  by law;อพ and, the information pertains solely to a health care service or item that you, or a third party other than the health plan or other third party payor, have paid for in full.</li>
